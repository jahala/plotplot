# Extraction Guide — `/petals init` Process

This document defines the structured process for the `/petals init <folder>` subcommand. Follow these steps in order. Deviate only when you encounter an edge case documented in Section 7.

## 1. Asset Discovery

Scan the source folder recursively. Catalog every file by type:

```
Expected types and how to handle them:
- .md, .txt, .html → Read as text
- .json, .yaml, .yml → Parse as structured data
- .css, .scss → Parse design tokens
- .svg → Read text content, then copy verbatim to assets/
- .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp, .gif → Copy verbatim to assets/
- .ttf, .woff, .woff2 → Catalog metadata (family, weight from filename), copy to assets/
- .pdf → Read with agent's native vision capability
```

Build a file inventory. Note which file types are present and which expected brand dimensions (colors, typography, voice, identity, assets) each file might contain.

## 2. Asset-Type Routing

Route each asset to the best native capability:

| Asset Type | Tool | What to Extract |
|------------|------|----------------|
| PDF | Agent vision/Read | Colors, fonts, voice rules, identity, logo usage guidelines |
| Markdown | Read | Parse sections for colors, typography, voice, identity |
| JSON | Parse | Extract structured design tokens, color values, font specs |
| CSS/SCSS | Parse | Extract custom properties, font declarations, color variables |
| SVG/PNG/JPG | Bash (`cp`) | Copy verbatim to `.brand/assets/` |
| Font files | Bash (`cp`) | Copy to `.brand/assets/`; catalog family and weight from filename |

## 3. Explicit-Only Extraction Policy

**CRITICAL RULE: Never infer. Never guess. Never approximate.**

When extracting from source materials:

- **Color values** — only write a hex, RGB, or CMYK value if it is explicitly stated as a color specification in the source. A color name alone ("Teal", "Warm Orange", "Dark") is NOT a color value. If the source says "Primary: Teal" without providing a hex code, flag it as missing. Never use vision to sample a color from an image or swatch.
- **Typography** — only write a font weight if it is explicitly stated. "Open Sans" without a weight is incomplete. "Bold" without a numeric weight (700) is acceptable if the source uses standard weight names. "Bigger" or "smaller" without a specific size is incomplete.
- **Voice rules** — only write forbidden terms and before/after examples if they are explicitly provided in the source. A tone description ("professional but approachable") without specific rules is guidance, not structured data.
- **Identity** — only write a brand name, tagline, or mission if explicitly stated. Never invent these from context or inference.

## 4. Ambiguity Detection

Flag every gap. A flagged gap is better than a guessed value.

| Gap Type | Detection Rule | Flag Format |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Missing hex | Color name without hex/rgb/cmyk value | `[FLAG: color-<role>] No explicit hex value for <role> ("<name>"). Provide hex code.` |
| Missing weight | Font name without weight | `[FLAG: typography-weight] "<font>" specified without weight. Provide numeric weight.` |
| Missing size | Font without size | `[FLAG: typography-size] No size specified for <role>. Provide px or rem value.` |
| Vague voice | Tone description without rules | `[FLAG: voice-examples] No before/after examples provided. Add examples to make tone actionable.` |
| Vague voice | No forbidden terms | `[FLAG: voice-terms] No forbidden terms list. Add terms to avoid.` |
| Contradiction | Two different values for same field | `[FLAG: conflict-<field>] Two values found: "<A>" and "<B>". Resolve and re-run.` |
| Empty folder | Source folder contains no files | Error: Source folder is empty. No `.brand/` created. |

## 5. Synthesis into Templates

For each output file, read the corresponding template from `petals/templates/`:

| Output File | Template |
|-------------|----------|
| `.brand/DESIGN.md` | `petals/templates/DESIGN.md` |
| `.brand/colors.md` | `petals/templates/colors.md` |
| `.brand/typography.md` | `petals/templates/typography.md` |
| `.brand/voice.md` | `petals/templates/voice.md` |
| `.brand/identity.md` | `petals/templates/identity.md` |
| `.brand/components.md` | `petals/templates/components.md` |
| `.brand/layout.md` | `petals/templates/layout.md` |

### 5a-pre. Product layers (multi-product organizations)

When the source material describes a brand FAMILY (an organization plus named products), write the shared truth to the umbrella files and each product's deltas to `.brand/products/<product>/` — accent claim, mark, tagline, product terminology. Deltas only; never copy umbrella values down. Single-brand sources stay flat.

### 5a. Derived machine views

After the templates are populated, emit two generated views (never templates — they are derived from the markdown, and the markdown stays canonical):

- `.brand/tokens.css` — every brand value as a CSS custom property, using the brand's own token prefix (take it from the CSS custom-properties block in colors.md when one exists; otherwise derive it from the brand name, e.g. `--acme-*`). Colors, font stacks, spacing, radius, strokes, shadows, motion. Projects import it and reference variables instead of hard-coding values.
- `.brand/tokens.json` — the same values in W3C design-tokens shape (`{ "$value", "$type" }` groups: color, fontFamily, space, layout, radius, stroke, shadow, motion). Build tools and Tailwind/theme configs consume this directly.

Skip a token when its source value was flagged rather than extracted — a generated view must not launder a guess into a value. Regenerate both files on every `/petals update`.

Replace each `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in the template with the extracted value. For placeholders where no explicit value was found:
- If the field is optional (metadata, visual theme attributes), write "not specified" or remove the line.
- If the field is critical (primary hex, heading font), write the appropriate flag (see Section 4).

## 6. Asset Copy

Copy all recognized asset files byte-for-byte to `.brand/assets/`:

```bash
mkdir -p .brand/assets/
# For each asset file in source:
cp <source-path> .brand/assets/<filename>
```

Asset files include: `.svg`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ico`.

Verify each copy is byte-identical to the source. Use `diff` or `cmp` to confirm.

## 7. Edge Cases

### 7.1 Empty source folder
Stop immediately. Report: "Source folder is empty. No `.brand/` created." Do not create any output.

### 7.2 Images-only source folder
Copy all image files to `.brand/assets/`. Populate the templates with flags for each missing text-derived field (colors, typography, voice, identity). The output `.brand/` will have populated `assets/` and templates containing only flags.

### 7.3 Contradictory values
If two different values appear for the same field (e.g., "Primary: #FF4D00" on page 3 and "Primary: #E7000B" on page 12), surface both. Write the first occurrence in the template and add a `[FLAG: conflict-<field>]` noting both values and their locations. Do not choose one silently.

### 7.4 Partial information
It is normal and acceptable for some templates to have more flags than values. A `.brand/` with three fully specified files and two flagged ones is more useful than five files full of guesses.

## 8. Voice & Tone Extraction

Voice extraction follows the same explicit-only policy but with a critical distinction: when the source provides forbidden terms, you generate before/after examples. When the source does NOT provide forbidden terms, you flag for human enrichment.

### 8.1 When source has explicit forbidden terms

For each forbidden term, generate a before/after example pair across 3-5 contexts:

| Context | Before (uses forbidden term) | After (rewrites without it) |
|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Marketing copy | Uses the term in a headline or value prop | Rewrites to be direct and clear |
| UI microcopy | Uses the term in a button or label | Rewrites to be concise and action-oriented |
| Error message | Uses the term in an error description | Rewrites to be helpful and human |

**Example generation rules:**
- The "before" must actually use the forbidden term (not a synonym).
- The "after" must preserve the intended meaning without using the forbidden term.
- The "after" must follow the stated tone (direct, warm, technical, etc.).
- Each pair should illustrate a different context.
- Generate at least 3 pairs, at most 5. One pair per forbidden term is sufficient.

### 8.2 When source has tone description but no forbidden terms

Write the tone description into the voice template. Add this flag:

```
[FLAG: voice-terms] No forbidden terms list in source. Add terms to avoid for actionable voice rules.
```

Do NOT invent forbidden terms from the tone description.

### 8.3 When source has no voice information at all

Add this flag to the voice output:

```
[FLAG: voice-missing] No voice or tone information found in source. Define personality traits, tone, and forbidden terms.
```

### 8.4 Populating the voice template

When filling `templates/voice.md`:
- Personality traits come directly from source text.
- Forbidden terms list comes from explicit source statements (not inferred).
- Before/after examples are generated ONLY from explicit forbidden terms.
- Grammar rules come directly from source text.
- Context-specific adaptations come from source text where available; otherwise flagged.

## 9. Constraints

- **No external tools** — This process uses only agent-native capabilities: Read, vision, Bash (`cp`, `mkdir`, `diff`). Do not invoke Playwright, Puppeteer, or any browser automation. Do not use external APIs.
- **No color inference** — Never use vision to extract a hex value from an image. Colors must come from explicit text in the source.
- **No value invention** — If the source doesn't state it, don't write it. "Not specified" is the correct answer for missing data.
- **Templates are the schema** — The template files define the output format. Follow them. Do not add or remove sections.
